## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is created under ITCS 6156 - Machine Learning at UNC Charlotte:

1. Finding, suspicious activity patterns in historical customer transactions under the compliance department of a bank. 
2. Using Supervised Machine Learning algorithms to reduce False Positives. 
3. Showcasing, Machine Learning algorithms potential to differentiate between regular ETL approach to detect suspicious patterns of customer activity.
